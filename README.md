# Global_Homicide_Rates
Graphs of Global Homicide Rates

This is a preliminary project directed to create graphs for the course 
'Criminality' of the Pompeu Fabra University Bachelor's degree in Criminology.
I was not able to find clear graphs for teaching the evolution of criminality in
different countries, so I decided to create my own.

I can updated and improved if requested. Future updates should include:
- Using World Bank and UN data API to download information.
- Improve graph design.
